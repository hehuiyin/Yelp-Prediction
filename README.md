# Yelp-Prediction

### Background and Business Implication 
Yelp is a Multinational Corporation who publishes online reviews and ratings for many businesses since its foundation in 2004. With around 178 million unique users per month, Yelp has created tons of valuable information for both the business and users globally.

With the increases of Yelp users, we would like to help Yelp to improve their application and help the new businesses to increase their visibility in the app. As Yelp users ourselves, we wonder how Yelp assigns the dollar sign to the businesses. We did some research online and found out that the dollar sign is assigned based on user’s answer on how much they spend on the restaurant per person through the survey questions that pops when someone checked in or after someone dropped a review. Yelp's formula in assigning dollar sign is: $= under $10, $$= $11-30, $$$= $31- 60, $$$$= over $61.

We found out that some new businesses don't have dollar signs which inspires us to make a prediction model to predict the dollar sign for the new businesses so that it will increase the visibility of these new businesses when users are filtering by dollar sign and improve Yelp’s app.

We also noticed that most of the expensive restaurants in Southern California are located in the expensive housing property areas (e.g. Beverly Hills, Laguna Beach, Newport Beach). We want to see if housing price is also an important attribute in affecting the yelp dollar sign so we combine the Yelp and Zillow dataset. 

Through the project, we can help:
1. Yelp: this will help them improve their app. 

2.  New Businesses on yelp: the prediction will create more visibility by assigning dollar sign for the new businesses to make them filterable (by dollar sign).

### Goal
To predict the restaurant pricing based on housing prices and other restaurant features and find out what kind of features are more
important in predicting the restaurant pricing.
